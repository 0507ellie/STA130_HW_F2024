For example, when I searched for the function \"describe(),\" Google yielded many unrelated results, while ChatGPT gave a direct definition with examples, making it a faster and more focused resource for learning and coding assistance. While ChatGPT is incredibly helpful for well-defined problems, I’ve noticed that it occasionally struggles with more abstract or highly specific questions, requiring more clarification on my part."

However, after seeing how it helped clarify complex topics and provided relevant examples, I realized it was more of a guide than a shortcut. For instance, when learning about probability distributions in STA130, ChatGPT provided me with clear examples and analogies that made abstract concepts easier to grasp. This helped me understand not just the formula, but the reasoning behind it. Although ChatGPT is great at breaking down complex topics, I’ve noticed that it sometimes misses nuances or provides overly simplified explanations for more advanced topics, requiring me to consult other sources as well."
