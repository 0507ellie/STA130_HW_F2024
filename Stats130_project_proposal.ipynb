    "\n",
    "### Variables and Exploration Plan\n",
    "- **Outcome Variable**: `WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health`\n",
    "  - Description: Self-reported mental health rating on an ordinal scale\n",
    "  - Visualization: Histogram\n",

    "\n",
    "  - **CONNECTION_activities_visited_friends_p3m**\n",
    "    - Description: Frequency of in-person friend visits in past 3 months\n",

    "    - Description: A combined measure of all social interaction types, created by summing standardized frequencies.\n",
    "    - Visualization: Scatterplot against mental health\n",
    "      - Rationale: To visualize the potential linear relationship, with an added trend line to show correlation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression will be used to determine the relationship between the composite social interaction score and mental health ratings. This method helps identify significant predictors and the strength of their association.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis and Expected Results\n",
    "- Hypothesis: Higher levels of social interaction, including virtual forms, are positively associated with better mental health ratings.\n",
    "- Expected Outcomes: A positive regression slope is anticipated, indicating that increased social interactions correlate with improved mental health. It is expected that in-person interactions will have a stronger positive correlation than virtual ones."

    "  - Visualization: Bar chart showing proportions of each category.\n",
    "    - Rationale: To check the sample sizes of each group.\n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "Bootstrap hypothesis testing will be conducted to compare mean burnout scores between WFH and non-WFH groups. This non-parametric method is ideal for non-normal data and provides robust confidence intervals for mean differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis and Expected Results\n",
    "- Hypothesis: Employees who transitioned to WFH are expected to report higher levels of burnout due to factors such as isolation and work-life balance challenges.\n",
    "- Expected Outcomes: Significant differences in burnout scores are anticipated, with WFH employees showing higher average scores."
